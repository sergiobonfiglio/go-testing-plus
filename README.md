# Go Testing+

Run individual Go tests, sub-tests, and (static) tableâ€‘driven test cases directly from the VS Code Test Explorer.

## Overview

Go Testing+ augments the official Go extension's testing UI to give you fineâ€‘grained control over Go test execution. It statically discovers:

- Test files (`*_test.go`)
- Topâ€‘level test functions (`func TestXxx(t *testing.T)`)
- Nested `t.Run("case", ...)` subâ€‘tests (including those generated by simple tableâ€‘driven tests)
- Nested table tests (recursive `t.Run` chains)

Then it lets you run exactly the scope you select (single case, whole function, file, or all) via a dedicated run profile: **Go+**.

## Features

- Automatic discovery & refresh of Go test files (`**/*_test.go`) via file system watchers
- Run profile: **Go+** (standard run)
- Run single subâ€‘test without executing siblings (narrow `go test -run '^Full/Test/Path$'` pattern)
- Support for nested table tests (static detection through symbol & reference analysis)
- Parses `go test -json` output and streams relevant lines into the Test Explorer
- Failure message parsing with file & line hyperlink locations

> Note: Dynamic names produced at runtime (string concatenation / computed fields) are not yet fully resolved; they may appear only when executed (see Roadmap).

## Requirements

- Go toolchain installed and `go` available on your PATH
- Go modules enabled (`GO111MODULE=on` implicitly set if not present)

## Extension Settings

No userâ€‘configurable settings yet.

## Commands & Run Profiles

Currently no custom command palette commands are contributed. The extension creates a single Test Run Profile:

- **Go+** â€“ Standard run (nonâ€‘debug) for any selected scope.

Debug support is planned.

## Known Limitations / Issues

- Dynamic table test names built from variable concatenation are not resolved (child may be missing in explorer until runtime parsing enhancement is added).
- Benchmark (`BenchmarkXxx`) and example tests are not yet discovered.
- No debug run profile yet.

## Roadmap

| Area                 | Planned Enhancements                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Test Name Resolution | Resolve dynamically concatenated names; runtime discovery & injection of missing subâ€‘tests |
| Debugging            | Add Debug profile using Delve via `go test -run` selection                                 |
| Benchmarks           | Discover & run `Benchmark*` functions                                                      |
| Coverage             | Optional `-cover` integration with inline decoration                                       |
